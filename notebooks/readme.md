# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis, visualization, and experimentation with the Anomaly Detector's data and knowledge graph. These notebooks are essential for understanding the data, testing hypotheses, and demonstrating the system's capabilities.

## Contents

- **`exploratory_analysis.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook dedicated to exploring the initial datasets, visualizing relationships within the knowledge graph, and performing preliminary anomaly detection analyses.

## Overview

### `exploratory_analysis.ipynb`

- **Purpose**: To provide an interactive environment for data exploration and visualization. This notebook helps in understanding the structure and patterns within the data, validating the schema, and testing the functionality of the source code modules.
- **Key Sections**:
  - **Data Loading**: Importing and loading data from the `data/` directory.
  - **Graph Construction**: Building the knowledge graph using `graph_builder.py`.
  - **Data Visualization**: Visualizing nodes and edges using libraries like `matplotlib` and `networkx`.
  - **Anomaly Exploration**: Identifying and analyzing anomalies within the graph.
  - **Pattern Analysis**: Exploring patterns and their associations with anomalies.

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites**:
    - Ensure all dependencies are installed as per `requirements.txt`.
    - The knowledge graph should be initialized and validated.

2. **Running the Notebook**:
    - Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
    - Launch Jupyter Notebook:

        ```bash
        jupyter notebook exploratory_analysis.ipynb
        ```

3. **Exploring the Data**:
    - Follow the sections sequentially to load data, build the graph, and perform analyses.
    - Modify or extend the notebook to include additional analyses or visualizations as needed.

## Contributing

To contribute to the notebooks:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Open the relevant notebook and implement your changes or additions.
3. Ensure that all code cells run without errors.
4. Document any new findings or insights.
5. Submit a pull request for review.

## Best Practices

- **Documentation**: Clearly comment and document each section of the notebook for clarity.
- **Modularity**: Break down complex operations into smaller, manageable code cells.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure that the notebook can be run from start to finish without errors.

## Future Enhancements

- Add interactive visualizations using libraries like `Plotly` or `Bokeh`.
- Incorporate machine learning models for predictive anomaly detection.
- Develop additional notebooks for specific analyses or use cases.
