# Simplified Knowledge Graph Project

This project aims to create a simplified version of a knowledge graph system, which represents concepts as nodes and relationships as edges. The goal is to support basic operations for adding nodes and edges, querying the graph, and reasoning about relationships between nodes using simple rules.

## Features
- **Knowledge Graph Representation**: Represent concepts as nodes and relationships as edges using Python.
- **Basic Graph Operations**: Add nodes, edges, and properties to represent information in a structured manner.
- **Rule-Based Reasoning**: Define simple rules to perform inferences on the knowledge graph.
- **Pattern Matching and Queries**: Perform basic pattern matching queries on the graph to locate information and relationships.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- **NetworkX** or **Neo4j** for graph manipulation

Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

1. **Create and Manipulate Graph**
   - You can use `main.py` to create a simple knowledge graph and interact with it.

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Examples**
   - Run example scripts in the `examples/` directory to learn more about how to add nodes, edges, and query the graph.

   ```sh
   python examples/add_pets.py
   python examples/simple_queries.py
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   - To ensure everything is functioning correctly, run the tests provided in the `tests/` directory.

   ```sh
   python -m unittest discover tests
   ```

## Usage
This project is intended for educational purposes, as a stepping stone to understand the basics of knowledge graphs, how relationships can be represented, and how simple inferences can be made. You can extend it further by integrating more complex rule engines or scaling it up to use databases like Neo4j.
