## Overview

The **Simplified Knowledge Graph Project** is an educational Python application designed to help you understand the fundamentals of knowledge graphs. It represents concepts as nodes and relationships as edges, enabling basic operations such as adding nodes and edges, querying the graph, and performing simple reasoning based on defined rules. The project is structured using various design patterns to enhance maintainability, scalability, and readability.

## Features

- **Knowledge Graph Representation**: Utilize nodes and edges to model real-world concepts and their interrelations.
- **Basic Graph Operations**: Add, remove, and manage nodes and edges with ease.
- **Rule-Based Reasoning**: Implement simple inference mechanisms to derive new knowledge from existing data.
- **Pattern Matching and Queries**: Execute queries to retrieve and analyze information from the graph.
- **Modular Design**: Structured using well-known design patterns for improved code organization and extensibility.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure reliability with unit tests covering various components of the system.

## Design Patterns

This project leverages several design patterns to create a robust and flexible architecture:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of the `KnowledgeGraph` exists throughout the application.
2. **Factory Pattern**: Centralizes the creation of nodes and edges, allowing for easy expansion of node and edge types.
3. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access, providing a clean interface for interacting with nodes and edges.
4. **Observer Pattern**: Implements an event-driven system where components can subscribe to graph events.
5. **Strategy Pattern**: Encapsulates different reasoning algorithms, making them interchangeable.
6. **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates graph operations as objects, enabling features like undo/redo and logging.
7. **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface (`KnowledgeGraphFacade`) to interact with the complex subsystem.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simplified-knowledge-graph.git
   cd simplified-knowledge-graph
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Project

Execute the main script to create and interact with the knowledge graph.

```sh
python main.py
```

Example `main.py`:

```python
from facade import KnowledgeGraphFacade

def main():
    facade = KnowledgeGraphFacade()
    facade.add_person(name="Alice", age=30)
    facade.add_person(name="Bob", age=25)
    facade.add_ownership(owner_name="Alice", pet_name="Fluffy")
    facade.perform_reasoning()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Examples

Explore the `examples/` directory to see practical implementations:

**Add Pets**

```sh
python examples/add_pets.py
```

**Simple Queries**

```sh
python examples/simple_queries.py
```

### Running Tests

Ensure that all components are functioning correctly by running the unit tests.

```sh
python -m unittest discover tests
```
